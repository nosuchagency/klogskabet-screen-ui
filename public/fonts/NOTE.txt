This project uses the GT Pressura Mono font from Grilli Type.
This is a commerically available font, which must be licensed from Grilli Type
for use on a website: https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-pressura

Therefore, the font is *not* included in this repository, but must be added
manually once licensed. The font's files *must not* be committed to the
repository.

And empty folder is included in the repo, where the font files should be
installed.

For development purposes, the font Bitstream Vera Sans Mono (a free and open source alternate font) is included and used as a fallback, if GT Pressura is
not present.

See the license for BitStreamVeraSansMono in the font's folder.
